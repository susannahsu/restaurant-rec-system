    "Our data was taken from this database of [Google Local Data 2021](https://datarepo.eng.ucsd.edu/mcauley_group/gdrive/googlelocal/#subsets). We previously used a smaller dataset of Google Restaurant reviews available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denizbilginn/google-maps-restaurant-reviews), with only 1100 reviews, but as per our TF's recommendation, we will be using this larger dataset with over 10m reviews for Massachusetts alone. To speed up our EDA, we will be using a sample of 100,000 reviews.\n",

The columns of interest are `gmap_id`, allowing us to join this dataset with the main one, `name`, which is the name of the business, and `description`, which is a brief description of the business. There is also a variable `category` that organizes the businesses into sectors such as non-profits, gyms, restaurants, etc. "

This aligns with the Google text review sentiment analysis, which found that the majority of the reviews had a postive sentiment. We also found that there is a weak correlation between the length of a text review and the rating given by the same Google user. However, it could be helpful to note that based on the visualization displayed above, the review length was longest for either 1 or 5 star reviews. In the sentiment review, we found that majority of the text reviews result in a sentiment score near 0, which suggests that many reviews are neutral.
