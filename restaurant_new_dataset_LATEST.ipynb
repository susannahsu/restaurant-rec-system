We previously used a smaller dataset of Google Restaurant reviews available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denizbilginn/google-maps-restaurant-reviews), with only 1100 reviews, but as per our TF's recommendation, we will be using this larger dataset with over 10m reviews for Massachusetts alone.

There is also a variable `category` that organizes the businesses into sectors such as non-profits, gyms, restaurants, etc. "

    "The structure of our problem is similar to that of designing a recommender system. We describe an initial approach that comes to mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommender Model Pipeline:**\n",
    "- **Training step** (preprocessing): Embed the reviews for all restaurants as vectors using sentence embeddings (BERT), or a combined approach using BERT and other feature engineered features from the restaurant information that we have. One approach is then to cluster restaurants in an unsupervised way in the feature space using an approach like KNN or t-SNE. Perhaps we can do this in an informed way, however.\n",
    "- **Interaction step:** Then, we may take a user prompt of sentence length describing the restaurant type they are looking for, and use the fine-tuned BERT pipeline to get a vector representation of the prompt.\n",
    "- **Matching step:** Then we can take the top recommendations as the closest three or so restaurants in the feature space to the prompt. We can incorporate additional heuristics in this matching step.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Issues:**\n",
    "- Reviews and prompts are semantically different. We might encounter unexpected relationships between the restaurants closest in the feature space based on reviews and the inputted prompts.\n",
    "- Perhaps a content-based filtering approach is more directly applicable as a pipeline (ref: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/content-based/basics).\n",
    "- With an unsupervised approach like this, we have no systematized way to measure whether our recommending algorithm is doing a good job at matching prompts to restaurants. But this is the nature of trying a recommendation system rather than a predictive model. We do not have the resources to conduct proper A/B testing, which would otherwise be a canonical solution.\n",
    "-  A collaborative filtering approach would be great, but is infeasible since we cannot recruit enough users. "

Had dinner here. My husband had a salad with grilled chicken and I also had a salad with grilled chicken. We also shared Brussel sprouts. Our server Janelle was nice and we enjoyed this restaurant. We will return if we're in the Area.  They had dividers between the booths. The oysters were tasty, with a nice variety to choose from. My wife enjoyed the avocado steak toast.  I enjoyed the fish tacos. Bar tender was attentive and offered suggestions when asked. Nice to get out and support local restaurant.. I ate the Blackened Shrimp Tacos, my sister had the Steak Tacos and we absolutely LOVED them. It was delicious and perfectly portioned. I had the Ceasar Salad and she had the clam chowder, both were amazing too. The service was more than great, I highly recommend this place. I will absolutely come again. They have lifetime customers.\n",

      "The cocktails are amazing and ordering off the menu was great too. I love this drink called \"Empty Glass\" and they had all the ingredients, the drink was spectacular! Food is great- somewhat of a gem in the area- food is prepared with care and the staff and service are 5 star! Will return regularly The Point has some of the best services and restaurants!! GRK never disappoints!  Every meal I have ever had has been amazing. A must have are the amazing Truffle fries. I have tried Truffle fries at other places and they will never ever compare to GRK fresh hand cut Truffle Fries!  The Caesar salad and Short Ribs is also absolutely amazing too!  Never had a bad meal.\n",

      "Great food. Good drinks!  Thank you Great Road Kitchen for feeding my tummy! Great to get back to indoor dining, Great Road Kitchen is a nice modern place and loud! Food was great tacos flavorful and the street corn is good .The only slip up was we didn't get the run down on the oysters which were great .\n",
      "Will be back . From the moment  you step in that place  the stuff gives you an agreeable feeling. Very hospitable hosts, it is a lovely restaurant to go out with friends and colleagues or with your date. tasty  food, professional  chief cook and stuff, good  pay and generous  service. Highly recommended. We had the best meal in a long time. The food and drinks were wonderful but, Nancy, our server made it so much better and worth it all. Always good.  This visit was to celebrate our anniversary.  Food was delicious, staff was attentive and talkative.  We felt safe and enjoyed the dinner. Finest spot to get food when in a hurry. The customer service is fast, prices are fair, excellent atmosphere. Would recommend to others The food was outstanding and the service was efficient, friendly but not too intrusive.  Sat outside on a beautiful day.  Oysters and shrimp were great.  Everything cooked with attention to detail and nice and hot.  High marks. The buttermilk chicken sandwich was great the barbecue aioli was perfect. I was having a bad day upon walking in there thus in a bad mood. And the sandwich put me in a great mood highly recommended. Janelle was our waitress and was pleasant and punctual. Didn't have to wait to sit inside and drinks and food was delivered with exceptional speed. Two thumbs up👍👍 The clam chowder took the chills off the frigid outdoor temps. The lobster fra diavo was terrific- with a spectacular presentation. Great brews on tap.\n",
      "The waitress was great.\n",
      "It made our Friday :-) Ordered the steak tacos and the steak was raw. Steak was chewy so all the steak would pull out after every bite. Did not report as it would have taken too long to fix. The French onion soup was great though. Too expensive for subpar food, not going back. I would definitely go back the food was delicious and the waitress Janelle was outstanding. Great atmosphere and clean and we had a cool waitress and was on top of her game. I wish I could remember her name! Pretty good.  Had the special the clams/ mussels were cold.  Server was busy..... I eat in this restaurant often! This is the best place to to have a good dinner.  I visit this spot at least once a month. The cooking is fantastic, the workers are welcoming and the price is reasonable. I enjoy going in this restaurant for a good lunch. This restaurant offers wonderful service as well as yummy menu. My favourite spot in the city. The meals served fast and the prices are fair. I recommend this place. This spot never fails to impress. They have great food for convenient pricing, there is no waiting time even when they are packed. We absolutely LOVE this restaurant and are regulars every 2 weeks and have been for almost a year! The staff are fantastic, Derek is incredible, as is the manager, Lisa, Chef Ben, Chef Tim, Chef Willy and the entire staff. My husband and I always order the French fries with extra truffle aioli and cast iron chicken, YUM! We highly recommend this restaurant! Great spot with good outdoor seating.  Fresh oysters.  Good draft beer choices.  I'll be back! Stopped in this past Wednesday and all I can say is, \"WOW!\" My experience might be different than most as I was there for a wine dinner, but I am certain that the quality of the food was the same. It was a five-course menu paired with five different wines (Fess Parker Winery wines) that hit every note. From the Island Creek Oysters that were served as appetizers to the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. Each coursed was an orchestra of flavors that melded so well. Easily one of the better restaurants in the area. If you haven't been you are missing out. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and very good food. The oysters on the half shell were the most delicious I've ever had. Risotto, was a tad bland, but my overall food experience was good. Great food, great atmosphere. Taking COVID precautions seriously. Highly recommend. The food was pretty good once it got to the table.  Be sure to carve out a good 2 hours for your meal. There was a man in a suit, clearly in a supervisor role, apparently his name is Marcus, who was walking around. He didn't seem to be checking much besides his wine glass which was near the kitchen. He was able to finish a bottle of wine in the time it took from us ordering to the time the entrees arrived. Ginger lime margarita was delicious.  Service was friendly and prompt. Outdoor seating socially distant and comfortable.  Oyster Po Boy sliders fantastic.  Shrimp tacos grilled and very tasty. Lively place with excellent beer selection, including local crafts, and great food using ingredients locally sourced. Calamari frites were delicious and so unlike the usual fried and chewy preparation. Staff was friendly and service was prompt and professional. Braised short ribs are great and pictured here. Modern place with a repurposed look. Very good service,  sandwich was a bit hard to eat but tasty. Littleton’s best kept secret. Everything is so good, but I LOVE the raw bar and atmosphere. The drinks are excellent too! Great to get out. Food was good and waitress very attentive.( First outing since Covid) We complied with government regulations and wore masks upon entering outdoor seating. We were initially  impressed as they had patrons who arrived without masks to have them retrieve and adhere to mask policy. Sad to say a family arrived unmasked and was greeted very excitedly by the hostess. She proceeded to walk this family of four UNMASKED by all the other other patrons sitting and having dinner to a cozy table in the back corner. Completely unacceptable and shameful 2 days out of re opening. I won’t be back to an establishment which does not have the safety of its patrons in the forefront choosing to have “regulars or friends “ not adhering to the the regulations in place to keep everyone safe. DISAPPOINTED Very well organised and convenient restaurant. They serve generous portions and for fair rates. I enjoyed the meals very much and the staff were super personal and informative. I recommend this place. First visit and I’m sure we’ll be back. Valentines night. Unique setting. Interesting. Waiter, Jarred, was excellent. Started with oysters. We enjoy sampling from different areas and comparing. We had fun with the four available that night. Delicious. Wine was super. My husband ordered a beer that Jarred recommended, and he was happy. We both order the salmon. Quite enjoyable. On Saturday my husband stated he was wanting more of the dish. Great place. Fun and different! Best lobster roll I’ve ever had,nice restaurant, healthy alternative available spaghetti squash with quinoa meatballs taste great! Was surprised to see that this restaurant is considered an oyster bar - I would expect oysters to be featured more. The menu is pretty eclectic at first glance, but everything is delicious. Great flavors. They were out of a few items so we had to make alternate choices. Clean, fresh food. Love the farm-to-table concept. Literally the BEST clam chowder I’ve ever had in my life. Highly recommend! Been here a couple times.  Overall food is pretty good but I would skip the paella if they have that special as it was pretty oily.  Wait staff is mixed as well.  Had really good and attentive and one that had to be asked if she could stop to take a drink order. Always a great meal here,,,my wife's fave casual place, you can't go wrong with anything here As we get the reopening of restaurants grk strands out for services and food well done Great fish taco and oysters burger !! Good selection of local beers. I enjoyed the food. Outstanding.  Drinks are excellent.  Food is excellent.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I'm only sorry our youngest started acting up forcing us to leave before entrees.  I highly recommend.  We had all the types of oysters and they were all fresh and well described.  Fresh grated horseradish that was the perfect potency.  The mussels were fresh and cooked very well.  Broth was mild to medium level of spicy.  The wedge salad was wonderful.  The bacon pieces were cubes, not slices, and the lettuce, tomatoes and blue cheese crumble filled dressing was very well prepared. Our first time here, the food and service was incredible! I had the tofu tacos. We WILL be back! Really good food for an American restaurant.  Very surprised that everything was tasted nice.  This place should be used for Americans to base what good food tastes like. The food and service were wonderful. The cocktails were good. The wine was excellent. We had a large group with many different allergies, intolerances, and preferences, and they were very accommodating and conscientious of all of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though it was a quiet night, the food did take a really long time to come out. We were seeing a movie, so we ended up being rushed, but once again the staff did what they could - our server made sure we had to-go boxes and we were able to pay quickly and we arrived at the theater *almost* in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely come back but maybe without the time constraint of a movie, or with a smaller group. It seemed we just had a lot of factors going against us that night! Excellent food! We went during prime time and at least for me, it was pretty loud and hard to hear table conversations, but we did have a good time. Would recommend it. Excellent food choices, everything was very fresh and made from scratch.  Oysters were tasty.  Wine was as expected Awesome raw bar and lobster roll ( whole lobster) !! Went here with a friend.  It was mid afternoon so not crowded.  Took forever to get our food.  At least 30 minutes for a hamburger.  Finally got it and the bun was burned.  The waitress was very nice and they replaced it.  Hamburger tasted good.  Truffle fries not worth the extra money.  First time I came here food was excellent.  This time I was disapointed. Well I wasn't poisoned, so I'll give them two stars.  Service was slow. Appetizer, fig & goat cheese, had no fig. I finished fish pot pie b4 replacement app, wedge salad, arrived. Wedge had almost no dressing. Bill still had fig &goat on it, waitress got surly w us when we asked for it to be removed. Menu is limited, maybe more of a sports bar. Had dinner outside.   Waitress with very short brown hair and nose ring waited on our party.  Poor service.  Out of wine we ordered.  Tried to sell a “comparable wine” that was more than double the price.  Could not open wine we ordered - cork fell apart.  While none of this was her fault - her attitude really sucked.   Poor customer service - took 40 minutes to get a drink.  Ignored table. I’ve been twice and both experiences were pretty good, the first was 2 months ago and I had some simple Mac n cheese, it was pretty good but this time I went, I got their steak frites and they were killer, some of the best I’ve had no joke, but my aunt did get a little hair in her clam chowder, which was kind of disgusting. Absolutely phenomenal restaurant. I've never had anything here that was less than stellar, and all of the staff have been fantastic. Would highly recommend coming here! The butternut squash bisque was great and the creme brulee phenomenal! My chicken dinner excellent and the ny sirloin strip cooked to perfection. Bar service with Greg top notch. The lobster roll was great and the corn was surprisingly cooked/seasoned to perfection. Just make sure you either have plenty of room or some help before tackling the blondie sundae.  This was easily one of the better meals I've had in a long while. Staff were extraordinarily responsive and friendly. Great road kitchen has bar non some of the best food outside of Boston, but i just want to let everyone in on a secret, before they gone on about terrible table service.\n",

      "It's really, really hard to find dedicated quality help out in the boonies, even when i lived in Framingham there were always problems. So it's the reality of the situation when you set up shop in an affluent neighbourhood where all the rich kids grow up to be engineers, and labor laws are so tight they can't snag any of the immigrant population due to just not being that large\n",
      "\n",
      "So expect a hit or miss table experience, no matter where you eat. Outside area bring your own bugspray! There late and had to finish meal inside. Food is uneven.\n",
      "Overcooked here... inventive and delicious there.\n",
      "You learn what to order and what not My wife and I went there after buying new car.  The bartender was awesome.  Recommended both great wine and food.  Very friendly and accommodating.  Thanks for wonderful experience. Ghost pepper calamari was not spicy at all. Fish taco was deep fried, I prefer grilled or broiled. Both tasty though & service was good. Average food, slow service Good food and atmosphere. Pricey but mostly worth it. Large space to hang out with groups of 15 or 20 people.  Unique menu.  Order main courses along with appetizer to avoid waiting in between. Had a selection of oysters and a bowl of clam chowder.  Everything was excellent! The bartender was polite and professional, and made good recommendations.  Love this place! I ate here twice in one week, with the second visit due to both limited local options and my desire to give them an opportunity to dispel my first impression. Sadly, both visits were consistently uninspiring - if not downright disappointing. The chowder, which they brag about, was cold, think like oatmeal, and devoid of clams. Go figure. The lobster roll looked great, but was actually completely over cooked and/or frozen lobster. Fresh lobster is flavorful and firm, while this was bland and mushy. Etc etc. Avoid. Great oyster bar. Good selection of bottled and on tap beers. Good selection of wine. Full menu with many good steak &  seafood, burger and sandwich choices. Reasonable prices. Good to place for lunch and dinner. I had the fish tacos and they were excellent. Great food, incredible taste. Cocktails on point, beer list A+, wine menu is superb. Staff is friendly, Oyster bar is fun,  highly recommend Was excited to go here, but was very disappointed. Food was mediocre and overpriced. We did like the upscale atmosphere. Well prepared food, good service. It is quite loud and difficult to have a conversation but overall it was a good dining experience. Excellent food, great service.  Noise level high.  Hard to carry normal conversation. Excellent food and service. Great food and Sunday brunch but get there early before they run out of corned beef EXTREMELY slow service on a TUESDAY night, a waitress that was barely around, and food that was served lukewarm and underwhelming. Cheesecake was served room temperature and mushy. Pretty inside, but it doesn’t make up for the odd menu options and bad food. They’re not quick to compensate and it’s expensive. I’ve tried this place twice but each time my meals have been so bad. I wish it wasn’t so. Maybe they need menu change? I always like coming here when I am visiting my head quarter's office.. food is great, people are awesome. Give it a try! First time, loved it, one of the top 3 chowders to date!  The search continues! If there was an option for no stars at all, that would be the upmost appropriate way to describe my experience here. Staff was incredibly rude from the start. The lack of customer acknowledgement and unfriendliness was overwhelming. The food was good but how would they know---the waiters don't even check up on guests to make sure everything was okay. Instead, I was stuck with a waitress who was unpleasantly rude; most evidently portraying that she did not want to be there. If she doesn't like working here, she should quit! Visited at 1:30 on a Sunday. Menu was VERY limited. Apart from breakfast, if you did not want a salad or seafood the choices were a $16 Roast Beef sandwich (more on that in a minute) or a $17 Hamburger. Specials were a $14 bowl of chili or a $21 local source hamburger. See menu pix attached.\n",
      "I got the roast beef sandwich with fries. Portion size was very generous and the reality is that the sandwich with the horseradish sauce on it was too big to eat as is, and too messy to try. Open face was the way to go. Roast beef was OK at best, think thick sliced deli meat from the supermarket. If this had been less messy and short enough to eat as a sandwich the thickness and mediocre quality of the meat would have made that a challenge anyway. Overall it was filling but that's all the nice things I can say about it.\n",
      "My wife had the arugula salad with chicken. This was an excellent dish and is responsible for the 3 stars this review did get. Chicken was very tender , well cooked and flavorful. Salad greens were fresh and dressing was well matched to this dish. In the unlikely event we return, I would have to consider this myself.\n",
      "Facility is large with a nice outdoor seating area. It was a warm spring day here and the outside was open for dining. It appeared to be an afterthought however, this early in the season places have a tough call on whether to offer outdoor dining. If you are going to do it, do it right and completely. Today no umbrellas were open and it gave a poor impression, far from inviting , like sitting at a table in the middle of the parking lot.\n",
      "This place has been on out \"to try\" list for a long time. I really wanted to like it but the limited menu choices, marginal value and average execution on my meal left us disappointed. Very dark in room even though we asked for more light. Warm tap water to drink.\n",
      "Raw greasy burger. Roll fell apart as soon as came to table. Burnt french fries. Service was good. Felt sorry for the staff who were trying. BTW only two other tables had customers. Busy was not the excuse The location is a bit odd, in that it is in a new shopping center that is empty, and the shopping center location is all by itself. The restaurant is well decorated and has a nice atmosphere without being too loud. Apps are about $10 on average. Entrees were about $24 on average. Dessert was $7.50. The food came out timely, presentation was great, and the food tasted great. Service was excellent as well. Portion sizes were on the medium side. Overall, I would highly recommend visiting this place before the shopping center fills out and it becomes crowded there.\n",
      "\n",
      "PS: I don't think the restaurant's name does it any justice. I've eaten here twice, when in our company's Westford office.  Both times the food was spot on.  Both times the beer list was IPAs and pale ales with  only one other option on tap.  I get that that's the local style but dang, it's not like the beer list was SMALL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was friendly and reasonably timely. I consider this a good choice for business trips. This was our third time here and the food it good but not great especially for the price. The raw oysters were very good but my sword fish and rice could have used more flavor. Good bar drinks, but I just don't get the cold Hawaiian sweet bread rolls before dinner. Doesn't make sense. Also, the lobster guacamole was overpowered by the smoked bacon. I really want this place to be successful but for the price, the food should be much better. Been here a couple times.  Staff is always friendly and food is pretty top notch.  Give it a shot! Great food, good beer selection, excellent oysters. Try the lobster and bacon guacamole. Food was awesome. Special was locally sourced and amazing. And staff was quick, efficient and friendly. Will return What can u say ? Who knew? Tucked away in a mall,unexpected pleasure ( the best kind,right ?)The staff,so professional, just happy your there .now the food,I'm boring so I had the wedge salad,just order it. I had steak frites, steak cooked correctly, fries tasty,but a little soggy,oil change needed, or cook at higher temp for more crisp,also ketchup not offered,my I suggest ketchup will soy sauce, get combo. My date had the salmon, there was none left on her plate, so ,u know. Take the time and go. Service was fine. Food was unremarkable. Decent burger but fries were very dark? Dirty oil? Scallop special had good scallops but weird cheese and cold beets. I have enjoyed the chili at lunch but won't hurry back for dinner. Good atmosphere, great oysters. Main dishes are a bit pricey imo. Service was alright. We waited almost 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server after we were seated. Thought the food was overpriced for the portions. Sat at the bar for drink after dinner and service was excellent. Wont ne back for a while. Oysters on the half shell. Lobster guacamole with bacon. Great beer selection. Fun atmosphere. Good service. I have been here a few times and the lunch and dinner have always been great. The food is A+, but limited. The drinks are a bit on the expensive side but for a nice night out, it is certainly worth it. Went there two nights ago and sat at the oyster bar. Had an incredibly good seafood pot pie and told the waitress to please compliment the chef. The chef came out and personally thanked me and had a conversation. Things like that don't happen at places where the staff isn't passionate about customers and service. This is my longest review because this is my new favorite lunch and dinner location. Try it! Great food the service was excellent and very quick and the timing between apps and dinner was spot on. Terrible food!  The appetizers were awful, and the salad was so salty it was inedible. Excellent experience. The truffle fries were amazing. Ceasar salad made with real anchovy paste...so good. I had the Salmon Burger for lunch. Also just perfect. Service was spot on. Not busy either. I recommend. Consistently very good food. Noise level keeps me from giving it 5 stars. A reliable go-to restaurant for date night or for taking guests. Came here for drinks primarily. Food was good, service was okay. Pretty unremarkable but by no means a bad restaurant. Love the food but wish they would change the menu more frequently. With such great chefs, terrific organic food, there should be more variety to the menu so that returning customers can appreciate the talented staff. Great atmosphere and superb food. Every dish we ordered was better than the other. They have raw bar, fresh locally farmed ingredients and great desert options. Highly recommend that you visit this restaurant. Tough night. Our apps were great. Chowder was very good. Then, a :50 wait for our second course with no explanation as to why. My grilled cheese with smoked duck was stone cold and dry. Our bet, the meals were somehow lost in the kitchen. For the first time, I sent my dinner back. Must have been an off day in the kitchen as the tables on both sides of us also had issues. Strange service as manager and wait staff had no explanation. Will take me a good long time to summons the courage to try this place again.\n",

      "Our first time here a few months ago was a five. We came here with husband, two kids and the grandparents.  We had to wait up front to check in as there was no hostess standing there.  After about ten minutes she finally came.  She asked how many in our party and I said four adults and two kids.  She seemed confused ( perhaps new) Then she had to get a manager.  He explained no table available but would be one in about 20 minutes.  We decided to wait. They have a shuffleboard game there and no one was using it so I decided to keep my kids entertained by teaching them how to play the game.  The manager was not happy.  He came over.and told us to stop.  Then well before our table was ready he told us he could get a table ready sooner.  He seemed frustrated that we had young kids and was hurrying us to our table.  Once we got to our table we had a waiter who was somewhat friendly.  Food for kids and husband was good. However I ordered the roast beef and it was absolutely horrible.  It was half cold half warm.  They forgot what I thought was going to be a slice of cheese.  It turned out to be a disgusting weird colored cheese sauce that was partially melted.  The bread was so soggy I couldn't pick it up with my hands.  I had to eat the sandwich with a fork and knife.  Their fries are Brown and all ends pieces! Bummer!! This place is awesome! You can argue with your spouse the whole time and still enjoy it! I did, trust me. This is certainly a whisky place. Try their specials! They're all phenomenal! Salads are amazing and the steaks are up a notch from most of the high end places you've been! 5 stars because even the host made a stellar impression with a special cocktail. Good food and service in past visits but poor service and just OK food in latest visit. Maybe just the B team on a week night; hope this is not indicative of their future. At this price point, one expects more consistency. Great meal last night at the Great Road Kitchen. Salmon, swordfish,  and  Steak Frites were all hits! We love this place. Open kitchen making great food. Fun staff. Great food and service. Easy to talk with people at table. The service was as poor as the food was fabulous. Additionally, the management refused to split our bill, and refused to remove gratuity from the bill. I signed the receipt for a smaller tip, and the restaurant charged the full amount anyway. I have since disputed the transaction with my credit card company. If you would like excellent food, don't mind poor service, and have cash, then I can highly recommend this restaurant. Otherwise, you might be interested in any other place - I suggest walking down the road 50 yards to Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza! All around good package. Big restaurant! Too slow, too loud, too expensive.  On my final visit, I opted for a $22 taco trio of overcooked, chewy steak and rubbery tortillas.  GRK is basically industrial floorspace with food served on frayed plastic mats.  There are better options nearby for less money.  The prices on the website are wrong. Really good combination of flavors. Service was awesome. No rush great pace. Food was amazing. I had the Steak burger , rare , and the chef had the acumen to still provide perfect Bark. The oysters perfectly served. The bartender seasoned enough to provide punctual service without hovering.\n",
      "If you want quality food served professionally you will love this place. Lastly . I'm highly suspicious of the recent critiques. Prices are on the menu and if you want \"Romper Room\" go one more exit (32) off 495. There is a super fun McDonalds and some other \"GUYS\" slop. Our first time eating here, we will definitely go back. All of the food was prepared perfectly. You can tell amount of time and thought taken preparing entree groupings, sauces, spices, etc. I didnt think I was going to enjoy it as much as i did....kind of caught me off guard. 5 stars. Everything was great.  Sat at the bar. Had great, attentive service. Food was unique and delicious! Fun, interesting drinks. Good atmosphere. Highly recommended! I will start this out by stating that they call themself an oyster bar, but that is not my thing, and I was just looking for a decent meal alone.  The food was okay, I am not the only one who has noted that they overcook the red meat.  I ordered a cheeseburger, medium (and they told me that it would be a warm pink middle).  It was well done, no pink.  The fries were overcooked, as well, but I had no intention of waiting for it to be redone, as it had taken too long to bring it out the first time.  I have had better experiences in some higher-end chain restaurants.  Nothing separates this restaurant from its competition. Great food sets the tone here, and I highly recommend sitting up at the oyster bar to see some fantastically talented cooks and chefs. Oysters are always on point, the people shucking are extremely knowledgeable, the NY sirloin my wife had was huge and cooked perfectly. I'm a burger guy and the GRK burger delivers every time. Great food and great service. Excellent menu and service continues to improve.  Pricey fare but what is not expensive anymore.  Go and enjoy a great meal in a bit of a noisy environment.  Very glad to have a quality venue in our location.  Keep up the good work. Wonderful. Excellent food fantastic cocktails and of course the oysters...awesome My husband and I went here because our neighbor told us it was amazing. Well it did no disappoint. We sat at the bar by the kitchen and saw every impeccably plated dish pass by, and our mouths watered! When our meals arrived they looked so awesome we didn’t even want to touch them... but we did and to our surprise they were even better than they looked. My 250lb grill master husband said “best steak I ever tasted”. SOLD! The staff that went out of their way to make our first experience above and beyond: Jacob, Nico, Nick, Johnathan, Matt, Chef Sean, and our very sweet server Barbara you all are a great team! Marcus the owner, even took the time to come say hello! My husband and I definetly recommend this restaraunt for an amazing Friday night out... and I don’t write reviews often. Really was looking forward to dinner outside during a nice 75 degree evening. We made a reservation in advance but they said reservations can't guarantee outside seating. Baby sitter ran late so we called and let them know. They said not a problem. We clarified that the only reason we were coming there was for the outside seating. They repeated we can't guarantee outside seating but it shouldn't be a problem. 15 minutes later we showed up. They said sorry but said that we can wait around 30 minutes to eat outside. We counted 6 open tables with settings on the tables. As we left I asked a server if those seats were available. She responded that they were reserved. I don't mind a wait but never lie to the customers. We've been there several times this spring. And this just sours both of us on date night. The food is good but a little overpriced. Best food ever!!! Great food and service as usual. Short ribs , pulled pork Mac and cheese and Seafood pie were delicious. Kyle was very attentive. Popped in on a Sunday night for a night cap. Decent food, nice atmosphere and good service. They also have TVs all around the bar with sports, but not so close to the main restaurant to spoil the dinner mood. It is a nice chain restaurant. If you like chain restaurants or just need a place to go out for business it is a great place. They make it feel that it is a step above macaroni grill, but it is still a chain. A great spot with excellent attentive service and delicious food. We had the clam chowder, a few salads, shrimp and a burger and all were very satisfying. A plus is a great draft beer list. Recommended. Awesome place. Creative, rotating menu, great drink selection and knowledgeable staff. Had a wonderful time.  Loved being able to eat outside.  Friendly, efficient service.  Good menu, food was delish. Interesting dishes that are well prepared. The oyster-wine pairings are a unique touch. Brunch dishes are tasty and satisfying. Staff is friendly and prompt. Options are limited, about 15 entrees in total.  Prices are white linen service level, but service is atrocious!  Long waits lead to cold food.  We waited over 20 minutes for dessert on at Friday around 6pm.  That should NEVER happen.  Poor value at high costs Noisy, but great food.  Enjoyed and would recommend the lobster guac and the mussels. Everyone is complaining but my experience was just fine. Sat at bar. Terrific oysters, though 3.25 a pop (new normal- ugh)  Short rib entree was quite good. And, had the best glass of Cali red wine in some time: Krug Cabernet. I shall return. Always good, seasonal, fresh seafood and more! Need a date-night out with your other half, this is the place to go on a weekend night. Start off with the caesar salad. The charred steak tacos are hands-down the best I've ever had; better than any Mexican restaurant I've been to. Love the beer and mixed drinks options. It's a crafty, authentic, rustic, sexy place to check out. Good food, great service, great beer selection My favorite place in the area.  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot! It's refreshing to find beautiful food in an unpretentious atmosphere. We have paid more for a lot less quality elsewhere. Every dish we ate, from the raw seafood tower appetizer right through to the chocolate mousse with salt caramel dessert, was delicious and beautifully presented. The service was exceptional. Our waitress, Amanda, was very knowledgeable about beers as well as about the menu. There was a range of nice gluten free options for me and a cool air shuffleboard table near the entrance for kids. (We couldn't hear it from our table, BTW.)  We had a wonderful evening and look forward to going back. Will check out their lunches next time. Steak frites are the best I've had. Bartenders are legit and mix some mean and creative cocktails. Space gets a little loud but the food and drinks have never disappointed. Lovely staff, incredible dishes and wonderful outdoor seating area. Everytime I visit this place they have excellent service, a great beer selection, and amazing food. They have a good variety in terms of their menu and have a great freshness to their dishes. 100% recommend. We came here for the first time for dinner on Saturday night.\n",
      "The food was very, very, good.\n",
      "I loved the steak frite and everyone else enjoyed the hamburgers with fries. They had just the right amount of unexpected twists.\n",
      "And, deserts were also excellent.\n",
      "My creme brûlée was very good and the chocolate mousse was also a stand out.\n",
      "From the reviews, we were apprehensive so I am relieved that we ignored their comments to give it a try because they made it sound like ordinary bar food and it is not in that dreadful league.\n",
      "The only negative I am adding as a “ heads up” to management.\n",
      "We tried to our reservation on Friday for a 5:00 Saturday night dinner. When we called, we were told that we could not get a reservation and we should try one of the two nearby restaurants, ( an Indian one and a tavern across the parking lot)\n",
      "We made a 5:30 reservation, despite the cautionary tone on the other end of the phone.\n",
      "And we’re shocked when we came at 4:45 hoping to eat at the bar, only to find a neatly empty restaurant. We took a table and watched and waited for it to fill up. That didn’t happen until 6:30!\n",
      "So, if we had listened to to staff gone to another restaurant, they would have lost patrons with a empty restaurant.\n",
      "My husband and I were shocked The catch of the day was absolutely great!! It was haddock with green beans.\n",
      "The wait staff and managers take their job seriously and make sure you have a great experience. If you don't, let them know so they an fix it.\n",
      "One thing that I notified was that the chef's with beards do not wear a beard net. Maybe that is normal here.\n",
      "This would be a good place for a reunion, business lunch, or meet the parents dinner. It has an upscale feel without being pretentious. Amazing experience, the service was excellent Very good food, friendly service, but food always takes forever even when they're not busy A tad noisy and service was a little slow but very professional.  Great food, excellent presentation. Excellent food and great atmosphere. We brunch here and one of the salads. Brunch was excellent. Cast iron eggs and the French toast was very good. Salad had lots of shrimp and great flavor. For desert the creme brulee was done perfectly and the chocolate mousse was delicious and rich. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that the service was slow and dessert took a little too long to come out. We will be returning to try dinner sometime. Clearly the reviewers of this restaurant don't really get out much. Fantastic food cooked by a very creative chef. Food is fresh and local, sources everything for the neighborhood the biggest selling point in my mind (I met the farmer who provides the produce, you don't get much better than that). We need to be eating local people. Decor is nice, noise tends to echo, but is that really a problem. People are having a good time....  Top notch spot for the area. Great oysters, burgers and truffle fries. Service was just adequate. Overpriced and the food is average. The rolls served before dinner seemed like they came out of a plastic bag from market basket; No butter or dipping sauce. Service was average, wait staff seemed unhappy. Would not recommend this place for a nice dinner. The Bar is great and the place is in a cool location. The food was delicious. We especially loved the quinoa meatballs, sweet potato tater tots, shrimp and pesto pasta, and their French fries. Service and drinks were great, and the atmosphere and decorations are really nice. Will go again and again! Loved it the beef tenderloin was do delicious like cutting into butter melted in your mouth and the truffle mashed potatoes were Devine also had the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream sooo good one of the best places!!!!! Raw bar, great food, interesting beer selection, friendly staff; all's good! The place is amazing. A bit on the pricy side, but the food, atmosphere and level of service are worth it. Great food!   Why it doesn't make 5 stars is the small menu detail.  They have to get more variety. Nice to have a local restaurant offering excellent food for a special night out.  A bit too pricey to make this a regular stop, but the drinks were excellent along with a nice selection of beers, and the food was quite tasty.  We made the mistake of eating outside earlier in the summer and were being eaten alive by bugs, but I believe that they planned to get some mass bug repellent devices shortly thereafter.  Service was very friendly and appropriately attentive, and the wait was all in all reasonable. Awesome good .amazing people that worked there . Always have excellent food, and service!!! This afternoon my husband and I stopped in for lunch and we unfortunately had a bad experience. The hostess was very friendly & our waiter was okay. However, we had a long wait (even though there were only 10 other ppl there) for our food and when we got our 21$ steak salad and rice bowl there was a lot of food...but flavorless. The steak was super chewy and could barely eat it. Even the clam chowder, which is usually really good, wasn't as good. We will not be returning after this visit. Delicious food. Loved the Lobster guacamole & chips.  Service was great and our server was very informative. We will be back!! Love the food. Typical warehouse acoustics these days. Great relaxed food, a bit special dishes. Everyone should find something. Nice with colleagues Delicious food.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Attentive wait staff.   Highly recommended! Had the smashed burger, was delicious. Delicious food! The panko-crusted halibut was quite tasty. Yum! Great atmosphere, no line waiting for table but it was very clear that the wait staff is not quite up to speed. The menu offers great variety and the food once delivered is excellent. Two major drawbacks... corn beef hash was more about potatoes: needed to search for the actual meat. And our meal took 45 minutes to come to the table. Not sure why it was so slow since we were seated with maybe 10 other tables in the entire place. We will come back for the food but will wait a bit to give the place time to settle into a groove. Steak frittes meal was fantastic and would definitely order again. Great service during pandemic Great grassfed burger from local farm. \"NY\" Cheese cake is not as advertised, clearly not a NY cheese cake . I don't think the chef has ever had a REAL \"NY\" cheese cake. Key word for those who have never had some is the word \"cake\" because it it freaking baked in an oven. Really really good food in a uniquely designed restaurant.  The staff worked hard to ensure our large party found seats and had a good dinner. The interior is very nicely done, but with all the hard surfaces the noise level is way too high. Unfortunately the fire alarm sounded while we were dining there and the volume of the alarm was way too high as well, painfully so. It would be smart to add some sound absorbing panels or accessories to make an improvement. lunch recently, big open high ceiling place with lots of windows and an open kitchen with available seating around it, nice!, ate at the bar, service was pleasant and attentive, burger was great with extras and as ordered (17$), martinis were good but average size and EXPENSIVE (16$ for a sapphire martini!!!), the lunch caesar was pretty and good but way too dry, i think the toasted bread crumbs they added just furthered the dryness.....so nice place, new and still learning no doubt, has a lot of potential!!! we stopped in once previously and had the shredded cauliflower salad and it was very good.... Went for lunch with a coworker, not only is everything incredibly expensive but for some random reason our waiter decided we \"weren't in a rush\". It took over an hour and 20 minutes for our order to finally arrive.... Lukewarm and incorrectly cooked. Apparently at this restaurant wanting to get lunch is a 2 hour affair and if you want it any quicker than this it's a rush order.\n",
      "\n",
      "My coworkers food was so wrong they took it off our bill. In the end we both had stomachaches that evening after having to work 2 hours of overtime to make up the 2.5 hrs it took us to get bad overpriced food at this place which we had to eat in less than 10 minutes. Food was great our server Boston Don was amazing! Great vibe. Place looks really nice. Always always slow. Tried at lest four times.\n",
      "Not worth the wait Great food, fun atmosphere. The noise wasn't bad at all. Excellent drinks too. Awesome great food and staff is so friendly and the line cooks really know how to shake it best part of sitting at oyster bar Good for sea food Great food drinks and service. Outdoor seating too It was a good burger and nice open kitchen To noisey and very expensive venue. Drinks: Robert Mondavi's Fume Blanc pairs very well with the shellfish, and the bar makes a great Negroni.\n",
      "\n",
      "The menu changes regularly, but I have never had a dish I did not like here. On this trip, we had clam chowder, oyster sliders, and the udon  noodle bowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "We love bringing customers visit our office here, friendly service and a great location. My favorite spot in Westford. Delicious food. Found this on yelp driving from Boston to the suburbs. Its a great place however limited vegetarian options,the service is simply awesome Very fresh seafood and unique takes on bistro favorites.  A little on the pricey side, but generally worth it considering the quality of the ingredients and the care put into the preparations.  We started with a dozen local oysters (Duxbury and Beach Point) which were fresh, meaty and expertly shucked - absolutely no complaints here.  I then had what was probably the best Steak Frites I've ever tasted, and my wife the fish tacos, which were also excellent.  With drinks and a tip, we were out the door at about $150, which wasn't too painful given that the service was also great. Innovative food urban decor Noisy but food is great Innovative ideas for food. We have visited this place numerous times and have had great experiences whether just for drinks or a meal. Staff is friendly, accomadating and food is really good Prices were a bit high for what is being put out. The raw bar was good, and the drinks were potent. Food is fantastic, they have a great selection of beers and whisky, Top notch. Fun atmosphere, sophisticated flavors, but nice and casual Good burger and good service. A bit on the expensive side. First time there, Had a glass of Merlot then a second, with Clam chowder that had the crackers in it already, I didn't like that and hardly any clams but potatoes, Calamari was small amount and cold, as for the Cauliflower.\n",
      "Way over price and biggest joke.\n",
      "Never again\n",
      "13 dollars for glass of house wine and the bottle cost  17 dollars, scam. Great food. Terrific atmosphere. Excellent service Great food. Great service. Awesome Meatball Mac and cheese. Nice digs but the food is a little on the safe side. Nice selection of beers on tap. Not impressed with the food,  also the server was nice but with bad memory.... pricey!!!!!! Went there last weekend with a party of 6. Service was good. The noise level was bad (even waitress had to yell). Par for the course these days I guess. A little ceiling noise treatment would go a long way.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered 2 mussels apps for the group. About 1/3 of them were closed and impossible to open. Sauce was very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the meals we got were meh, considering the upscale price. Fish tacos were deep fried (wish that was mentioned before ordering). We got upsold to the \"local farm\" burger, but the medium-rare burger we ordered came extremely well done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to give this place a while longer to find their feet before we return. Service is incredibly slow. Had to go find a waitress to get salt and pepper (and even then she didnt bring it).  Was told three times that they would bring water right away, never got a refill. And inside is very loud, hard to talk. Very enjoyable restaurant.  Would eat there again.  All of our food was great. Everything is awesome. Somewhat pricey usually about $50 a head for dinner Nice place good food and place to have game of shuffleboard Getting better with each try. All new restaurants need their kinks worked out, and they are getting better. Will return again. Fantastic meal, great wine, will be there again, and hopefully soon Great Cobb salad!! Pleasant atmosphere, and good service! Food was great, the place is noisier and when full it's hard to have a conversation at the table. It took longer than I expected to get meals ready. Great staff and good food. Slow service and if your sitting at the bar prepare for neck pain trying to watch the tv as they are mounted way to high. Great food and even better service   All food from scratch great wine list but beers were a little lacking Awesome service and good food.  I will definitely go back. Food was great. The service was great as well. Great food and a fantastic selection of beer, wine & cocktails. First time there. Hit between lunch and dinner so menu was limited but our food was great. Food is good and decent beer selection. The area it's in has lots of shopping too. It's a bit on the pricier side though. Surprised by the quality of the food and service. Great food and good atmosphere. Loved the oysters Great food. Little pricy, but only cause I order the seafood. Agree with other reviewer, Katie is the bomb. She rocks as a bartender.  Great food too! Good food, but a bit pricy for what I'd expect.  Definitely worth going. Great atmosphere, food was delicious and our waitress Janelle was very professional and knowledgeable about the food. Nice place with a lively vibe. Open kitchen with unique dishes. I'd like to start by saying I give reviews A LOT! I'm not one to only give a bad review out of anger. And I waited a few days to write this, as to not be biased.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trip started out well. 6:30 reservations on a week night. The place wasn't super packed when we got there. Nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waitress was really nice. Described everything really well. I ordered a beer and my wife got water. I wasn't listening fully to the water conversation, but I think there was tap, sparkling, and bottled. My wife got tap. They served it warm with no ice. If you ask me, this is done to sway you into buying a drink which my wife did. We'll get to that in a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beer came out and we ordered apps. My wife ordered a Caesar salad, I ordered the burrata, and my wife ordered a soda. This is where it fell apart. I got my beer and ordered the apps at 6:48. I know because I messaged my friends about the beer. The burrata came shortly after and entree orders placed.  Then, our waitress had disappeared. Completely. At 7:40... Let me write that out.. SEVEN FORTY PM... my wife had to flag a manager. It had been about 40 minutes since anyone had acknowledged us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had never gotten the salad, soda, or any entrees. The manager said he would comp the salad, but IMO he should have comped more. It was another 15 minutes or so before we got our entrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife got the steak special. It was awful. Just awful. Sure, it can be argued this isn't a steak place, but that was this evenings special. If you're going to feature a steak, do it right. They didn't salt the meat at all, which should be a sin... And for flavor it was just char. All you could taste was char. The inside was cooked as requested, but the flavor outside was overwhelming. If I wanted to eat char, I'd scrape bits out of my grill.  It was bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got steak frites and they were okay. They served the steak over the fires which made cutting tough, but it looked nice I guess. My steak had that char flavor as well, but not nearly as bad as the \"special\".\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife couldn't eat her steak and decided to leave. Our 3 year old, who was pretty well behaved throughout, was getting a bit antsy after being there for 90 minutes. Management came over again after they noticed this. I explained we had separate cars, so I was staying for the bill and she was taking the boy. It still took about 15 minutes to get the bill!!! Like... How would you NOT get a bill ready after 2/3rd of the party left and the remaining 1/3rd was sitting there on his PHONE NOT EATING!!!??? (Maybe I should have waited longer to wrote this review...)\n",
      "\n",
      "Waitress finally came over and asks if I'm ready for the bill. Naw.. let me chill here for a few more hours... I smile and say sure. I kept my cool there. Mistakes happen I guess... But the next part... She comes back with the bill and immediately starts talking about my son. She starts saying how well behaved \"the little cutie\" was. How \"it really shows how well we are raising him\" because he sat through that looooong dinner without crying at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady. I know my kid is well behaved. Stop fishing for handouts... She literally complimented my parenting skills for like 2 whole minutes. Look, you messed up. Everyone is entitled to a mistake every now and then. I'm not going to NOT tip you even though you failed me. I wish I didn't... But I did. Whatever...\n",
      "\n",
      "Last bit to this long winded review. This was the day after the last storm. I get that people were without power and they could have potentially been busier than normal. HOWEVER, people were getting their food all around us. A large group got seated after us and got drinks and salads before us. A smaller group was in and out while we were just IN. THE PLACE WASN'T BUSY!!! Gibbet Hill down the street was booked through the teeth and I bet they didn't have this issue...\n",
      "\n",
      "0/5 Never going back. Very expensive, not a good selection, loud environment even though there is no or very soft music playing. Parking is also very poor when it is busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mac and cheese special was good, but nothing else was worth the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also had to suggest to the manager that they put in a baby changing station in the men's restroom. Great food, awesome staff, good ambiance Good food. Comfortable atmosphere. Great food, good for two. Don't go with parties larger than four people or your experience will suffer. Very expensive.   Average food not great servox e.  It wasn't bad but not worth the price tag. Just went for drinks, but they have a great selection and a very knowledgeable staff. This place is trying too hard to be upscale. Everything is just a little pretenscious. Everything is also just a little too expensive. The food was just OK. I want to love this restaurant so bad.....however they consistently have bad service.  For the price they charge the service is subpar.  Their bar selection is also not at the level that would be expected for an establishment at this \"level\".  Do not waste your time, nor money......go a little further out or go to Gibbett Hill!  Will absolutely never come back here again! Great service! Very nice place 👍 Tasty food, enjoyable flavor combinations.  Not all executions are perfect, but the staff cared and seem to be enjoying themselves. The food is delicious! Love the raw bar! Unique menu, great food and service not the cheapest option but worth it IMHO. The chef here should be in Boston or NYC, he's that good! Pros: food was decent, wait staff was friendly, cool decor, extensive wine list. Cons: wildly overpriced, extremely loud inside, slow service, poor cocktail list So here we are again at GRK this time with my whole family. Very light on the martini olives...could have been better...We just finished our appetizers: mac-n-cheese w pork and chipotle flavor and our old standby truffle fries. Both totally awesome. Entrees all great. My 18 and 16 year old actually appreciate good good so we have learned. We'll all be back. Excellent oyster selection. The lobster rolls are delicious but small. Great atmosphere, great service, and great food.  Best oysters this side of boston. It's really great, nice servers, nice aesthetic, nice food. I don't even want to give this place 1 star.  This was our first time eating here.   And our last.   It's a nice looking place, big dining room and open kitchen.  Our waitress was very friendly. Positives end there.  We started with drinks, they offer water, either bottled or tap.  We took the tap, and it was warm.  They don't serve cold water or iced water.  We ordered 2 appetizers, one which we got and the other we didn't.  I didn't get my soda either.  After ordering our meal, our waitress disappeared for a good 40 minutes.  I finally asked the hostess to send over the manager.  He got me my salad and soda and said they wouldn't charge for the salad. The salad was a ceasar salad, and they served it with whole leafs of lettuce down to the white ends which were all turned brown.  If you're going to serve the lettuce that way, don't serve it with brown ends or just don't serve that way at all.  Also, there were bread crumb dustings and no croutons which I wasn't a fan of, I love my croutons. Our meal finally came about an hour and 10 minutes after we ordered, I wasn't impressed. I got the sirloin steak which was a special and it was chewy and just tasted burnt.   I didn't finish my meal, I hardly touched it because honestly at that point I was too pissed off to eat.  My husband and I had taken separate cars since we both came from work so I left so I could get our 3 year old home since it was almost his bedtime and my husband stayed to finish his meal.  It takes about 40 minutes to get home from the restaurant and I was about 10 mins from home when my husband called and said he had finally just gotten in his car to go home. So it took almost a half hour for them to get him the bill so he could pay and leave.   Ridiculous, considering both the manager and waitress saw me leaving, she should've gotten the check ready when I left.  I should've told my husband not to pay for any of it.  I got home angry and starving and ended up eating chef boyardee spaghettios for dinner which was more enjoyable than what I got at this restaurant.  Very disappointing. Nice interior and menu, food has been just ok Been here twice with my partners. Wildly overpriced, food is so eclectic that it borders on absurd. Food would be subpar at half the price. Staff is arrogant and whole place reeks of pretentiousness. Literally despise the place. Never again. One of the few Places that does blue / really rare steak well in the area! Overpriced, small portions, staff is nice but openly criticized ownership. Food is good but pricey. Noisy Stopped for a quick bite of something after a long day of showings in Boston area....1st time here  ..  one of my clients \"told me about\"..... I sat at the bar and enjoyed a delicious bowl of mussels in wine, glass of Malbec  and a side of roasted Brussel sprouts with goat cheese .... ..... met a fascinating, fun couple that we are going to a horse show together! Perfect evening ... with the exception of the Red Sox losing to the Yanks!! I'll be back! Great food, atmosphere, bartender Katie and clientele! An amazing restaurant the food is fantastic Great ambience, friendly service, and delicious food 👍 Nice menu, burgers done the way you like them, excellent service Dining Catastrophe!\n",

      "Stopped at Great Road Kitchen for dinner with a professional colleague (both mid 50's) for the first time two weeks ago on a Thurs evening.  We arrived at approximately 6:50 PM.  We were seated outside.  Restaurant was about 2/3rds full.  At 6:55 we ordered a draft beer and a water, and a few minutes later we ordered our diners from the menu....little did we know that these would be the only two items we would receive until almost 9pm  (not a typo).    Some of you are probably wondering why we didn't just leave....read on....\n",
      "\n",
      "At approximately 7:30 we were growing a little concerned that dinner was taking awhile so we flagged down our waitress and asked her to check on our food.  She apologized and promised to be right back.  At 7:45 we found her again (she never came back) and asked if we could speak to a manager....numerous people around us had been seated and were eating.  The manager arrived and explained that our order had gotten mixed up, and that the kitchen was struggling to manage a wedding rehearsal dinner.....no problem...we weren't in a rush and these things happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 8:20 we flagged down the manager again to inquire about our food.  He apologized, told us how embarrassed he was, and promised our food would be prepared next.  He also told us he would \"take care of the bill\".\n",
      "\n",
      "At 8:45 we decided to leave.  Two hours in, we had one empty beer glass to show for our time....no bread...no nuts, no refills...  I went to speak with the manager to let him know we were leaving.  I met him just outside the \"open kitchen\" line.  He apologized again...while we were talking, the cook (who was standing at the counter) shouted out \"Denny's is right down the street...\"   At that point I was really pissed off.  We had been very civil and patient...there was no screaming or yelling...just waiting like a couple of idiots.   Time to go.....the manager followed me out apologizing over and over for the remarks, and the delays.  He told me that our food was was right behind him .....(keep reading).\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point we were gathering up our things to leave when the plates showed up.....stupidly we ate them.  My food (salmon over greens) was actually very good;  my friend's meal (fish tacos) and truffle fries were almost inedible....the manager apologized again and asked if he could replace them....enough was enough.  It was 9:05 at this point...truly time to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "The frosting on the dinner....the manager brought us a bill for $33.00...his version of \"taking care of the bill\" was far different than what anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant would think it would mean....we dropped $40.00 and walked away.  Complete fiasco.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to contact the owners by email and phone before writing this review.  I figured everyone gets to have a bad night...right?  They never called or emailed me back.  My advice:  skip Great Road, or at least bring a good book! Great food with a large wine, beer and sprits list. Howevet, it was lively. Aka noisy. Too loud for easy conversation.  Nice they had a couple of vegan options. I really like this place. Great food but slow service We arrived around 5:15 on. Friday evening without reservations. This restaurant had only been open three weeks, but is apparently \"sold out\" on weekends. Indeed, when we left at about 6:30 PM only a few tables remained empty. The bar itself and the bar seating overlooking the busy kitchen were full. So reservations are strongly advised.  The restaurant is quite large, with a high ceiling, and very attractive. Perhaps 70% of the floor area is carpeted, which probably helps keep the noise level with reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various fresh raw oysters are offered, ranging from $2 to $3.50. But there is a very attractive rand of appetizers. In fact, I assembled my dinner from appetizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lisa, our server, was very gracious and well informed - and lovely. We were tempted by the seafood. Two specials were offered, with the price of each. (It is so irritating to have to ask the price of \"specials.\") My partner orderEd a sirloin burger. It was prepared exactly as she asked, and was accompanied by a bowl of fresh cut French fries. The burger was huge and delicious. (Half of it became her lunch the following day!) I had the onion soup ($8) which comes in a large bowl, suitable for sharing, very good, but tasted sweeter than most onion soups. I also had the steak sliders, which come are a plate of three - moist and delicious. I made the mistake of ordering a side of fries but soon realized that my wife's burger already was accompanied by enough fries for two people.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear that all the servers and kitchen personnel are well trained.  The food and drinks are excellent and the prices are reasonable considering the excellent overall experience. The manager, Adam Sheldon, stopped by our table to ensure we were satisfied and is assuring that every detail is done well. This restaurant is such a welcome addition to this area and is now on our \"favorites\" list! Very loud. Food is good but expensive. Hipstery place with decent food but it's overpriced. Our table got a laugh when we were offered complimentary rolls that were \"salted and glazed in honey\". We recieved store bought potato rolls, still cold with the tearable edges visible that were indeed salted and glazed with honey. Needless to say, I've had better bread at less expensive resterants. The drink selection is interesting but I was not overwhelmed by my mixed drink. I had clam chowder for dinner and it was good. My husband had steak tacos and he enjoyed them. We agreed that the food was good but did not live up to the expectations that we had built up due to the price. I visit GRK pretty often and it's just outstanding: the food, the service and the fully stocked bar make for a great experience every time we're there! Nice comfy atmosphere, service was great, roomy, oysters and shrimp were great, grk burger excellent, frites great, will go back.only complaint bread pudding overcooked (dry). Great place, food and cocktails! After sitting down and glancing at the menu not the place for me. Never have I ever had lobster guacamole and that wasn't going to be my first Excellent food and drinks Great for both adults and kids.  Fresh ingredients. Yeah no thanks no bread for lunch ... First time there, was impressed with quality of food. Environment was a bit noisey. Great food and service Over priced limited menu Nothing terribly wrong, but for the price it's not very impressive.\n",

      "the chicken parm sandwich I had was fairly tough and dry despite costing 13 dollars. Sections of the meat were chewy/fatty, which was disappointing since it means they don't trim the meat. There was also very little marinara on the sandwich; it tasted like a sandwich of cheesy, fried frozen chicken. I'm positive I could make a better chicken parm sandwitch in 30 minutes with 4 dollars of raw materials. Very consistent!! Always a great meal Good food, good wait staff, quite loud but it was very busy. I'd try it again. Consistently good food, nice staff, oysters! Great food, fantastic drinks. We had lunch at the GRK Friday.  We were driving from Maine to Washington, DC after having been on the road for two weeks and this was a wonderful restaurant to celebrate our last lunch \"on the road\".  I had the 'baha' white fish tacos with guacamole and my husband had the GRK steak burger with GRK frites.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We regretted we were not staying overnight in the area so that we could have enjoyed oysters with a bottle of wine.  But we still had many hours ahead of us on the road.  Our waiter was very attentive and responsive  to our needs.  The restaurant has a great vibe.  It's a fun restaurant and we only regret we don't live closer so we could go there often with family and friends. Great food and staff. Tasty with great service Always good food and good service. nice ambiance and good food We are (were) regulars at GRK. We live in town and were excited that a good restaurant with quality locally-sourced food had opened in our neighborhood.  However, we will never return after our experience last night. We were kicked out into the rain on New Years Eve at 1 a.m. when a manager overheard a comment regarding inconsistencies in the service. It's no secret there are many; quirky service is the main drawback there,  but the food is very good. I've been waiting for them to tighten up the front of the house before reviewing them, but after last night, we will never go back.\n",

      "The situation last night occurred when we were playing shuffleboard and finishing our cocktails while waiting for an Uber. We had had a lovely four course dinner and excellent cocktails and the pleasant evening of conversation with friends was winding down. The manager came by to tell us we had to leave because they had already been serving alcohol later than their license allowed for. A few minutes later, a server offered us another round and the manager turned and told her with some force, no, we're closed. She looked surprised. Hence the comment intended for our little group, which was something along the lines of well maybe they could figure out how to run a restaurant.... The manager used this comment as an excuse to expel us on the spot, cocktails unfinished, treating us like we were drunk and disorderly. The lack of professionalism was astonishing. I have years of front-of-the-house restaurant work experience and I've never witnessed anything like the treatment we got. As we were waiting for our Uber outside,  the manager continued to berate us from the doorway and when we responded with disbelief and anger, we were told to leave - we were not allowed to wait for a car in sight of the restaurant. He threatened to call the police and he barred my husband from ever entering the property again. Perhaps you may think we were very out of line and must have somehow deserved this, but I assure you this was not the case. Since the front lights were turned off as we walked away and a bunch of people were still at the bar, my best guess is that he wanted to clear us out for a private drinking party. Whatever the motivation for this behavior, I cannot recommend GRK to anyone. I am embarrassed that we went there on my suggestion last night. It is certainly no place to take guests or clients. A modern twist on fine dining with the best food and drinks you'll find outside of Boston Food was okay. When we asked for salt, we were given a dish of coarse salt. We were told that they didn't have salt shakers. A small thing but just came off as pretentious. 2 words. Mm Mmm Mmmm good! Good drink, nice atmosphere, great food. Food is excellent and service is impeccable! Delicous food, great service Great staff and good food. Very good. Nice place! Great menu and staff in a fun setting. Unique place. Now on my list of places Expensive but not surprising given the area. The steak frites is spectacular! Super nightly specials. Friendly, fast and courteous service. The breakfast burrito is delicious Great food if your looking for none chain food. Very limited menu at \"Blunch\". Will try again another time. Didn't appreciate the upsell on water when tap water was available but not offered. Great atmosphere and food -- a delight! Good ambiance and value for money Service and food fantastic New menu tuna & cod are fantastic. good food. but little expensive in this area. We just ate here and it was amazing! Amazing oysters and great drinks! The new regular spot in Westford Noisey, but great food. Wonderful place! L00@1 Nice but a little pricey Go on any night that isn't Thursday, Friday or Saturday and this place isn't any noisier than any other restaurant. Great bartenders, good atmosphere. A bit noisy. Everything is perfect here Short ribs were very tender, but lacked flavor. Its just...ok.... Great restaurant! Huge restaurant, loud, the food was ok, fun place to go with friends. Good food, tad loud Great food, great vibe! Great ambience & food! Great lobster guacamole!! They need to get another domestic beer other than coots lt Perfect as usual!!!! It's where dreams go to die and they have no vegetarian options Interesting menu and tastefully presented. Good food and good drinks. Standard food, pub type atmosphere, noise level commensurate to pub crowd. Great food. Had a reception there that was very nice Great food With so many places to go this place is ok\n",
      "A little pricey for what you get Great service and food Mmmmmm yum yum yum yum yum Great Great dinner. Excellent Good place to be It’s a restaurant... Pleasantly surprised AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! Great unique food and beer selection go to Burton's instead of here Just okay! Wasn't amazing wasn't horrible. Nice burger, a little expensive! Great place and fascistic service Great food Not good Way too noisy. Excellent food, great drinks Hostess was very rude to us. Decided not to stay and will not be coming back again. Pricey. The best! Walking in you smell an almost chemical odor. Hostess seemed confused, and waitress seemed combative. Great food, wine, and atmosphere! Great just a great place all in all. The drinks are great, food is great, atmosphere great, and staff are wonderful. When I was asked where I wanted to go for mother's day this was the place!

      "This establishment is home of one of the greatest pizzas ever made — not hyperbole. Thin slices, savory cheese, exquisite tomato sauce. The crust is like candy. Don’t overthink it, just order a standard cheese pizza and your taste buds will forever thank you. I’ve been a proud Marcello’s customer for a solid 15 years and can’t recall a single moment where I’ve been remotely underwhelmed, let alone disappointed. Marcello’s is the epitome of mouth-watering, small town pizza that leaves me devastated when I see the slices diminish one-by-one from the box. Do yourself, and your appetite, a favor and acquire one of their cheese pizzas. Honestly, if the Pope asked me where to locally indulge in a slice of pizza, I’d point them in Marcello’s direction and instruct him to order a few boxes. If I were to get married, I’d hand them a blank check and let them write as many zeros as they want to cater my wedding. Again, not hyperbole. Have a great day and some great slices!! Calzone and salads were delicious....cole slaw was amazing...     chicken fingers were ehhhhh.... standard frozen chicken....   can't wait to try the roast beef next time Bought a pizza there the other night.. the crust was burned on the bottom of the pizza. only could eat the center of the pizza.. or just the topping.. Not sure if cook was paying attention, if so would never eat here again, if this is the quality of the food. would never eat here again. sauce needs  a little sugar.. only bought from here cause moms they take debit cards.. or gift cards.. Place is horrible. Small portions,put orders together that shouldn't have been & more I wont be going here again. They were closed all last week and didn't leave message on there's phone service..that they had done so...was looking forward to lunch, and got to store... Signed said closed until 13th or 15th..\n",
      "\n",
      "Irritated I love Marcello’s so much. I get the roast beef sandwich on a grilled bun every time and I have never had one better from anywhere else! So delicious, great price and friendly workers! The Roast beef was so tender the sub roll was so soft just delicious my favorite sub place by far They might not have any thing out of the ordinary there but all the food they serve is good and The prices are also good. The Roast beef sandwich is one of the best around.And you can’t be their Tuesday pizza deal The best coleslaw on the East Coast. And I've traveled a lot and haven't found a better tasting one anywhere. Worth the trip from anywhere. I had 2 grilled hotdogs and fries and a LG drink.Good stuff! I wouldnt even leave a star but I had to in order to post this. I ordered a fish sandwich,  they used to have the best. What I received was Frozen Fish Sticks! When I complained to help I was told they cut it that way so it cooks evenly andthen as I walked away the help laughed about it. NICE. UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK. Best freakin roast beef sandwiches. Reminds me of the only thing I like about the North Shore. Steak & cheese is real good. And the large is 20 inches long Marcello's is a Whitman institution. Large menu. Quality items. Good prices. Great roast beef. Great Italian sandwiches. Pizza. Calzones. Hotdogs. Worth ordering. Stopped by to pick up a couple of quarts of my friends favorite coleslaw. Everything's always great, thanks Mo. One of the female clerks was not wearing gloves while handling sub rolls and an older male clerk was maskless  while handling cash trays  onion rings had little to no flavor sandwiches were very good I am being generous in giving Marcello Sandwich Shop a one star rating.  As a rule predominately most reviews are about the quality of the food.  I am writing a review about the manager and his employee. Many years ago, when my sister lived in Whitman, we ordered food from Marcello' Sandwich Shop almost every weekend. and continued to do so after she moved. We loved their shrimp scampi pizza, but sadly it was recently removed from the menu.  Recently I called to order a pizza, and kindly asked if they could make us a shrimp scampi pizza. The young lady returned to the phone with a resounding yes! We were thrilled, letting her know we were very appreciative.  Upon asking her the price she responded $16.50.  Within minutes the phone rang, and the very same young lady,  said it would now cost us  $32.50!!!!  We reiterated \" you're kidding $32.50 for one pizza!!!!  She replied , \"yes., the manager said that it was a special order, and therefore they were compelled to charge $32.50!  I have NEVER heard of a pizza of any kind costing  that much!!! I don't care if it came from Italy!  Not to mention that they have prepared it for us a dozen times before.. Charging such an exorbitant fee was insane!  Shortly thereafter we cancelled the order...DUH!   Immediately I called back asking to speak to the manager.  Upon answering the phone in a very rude manner, he said, \"that price is ridiculous it should have been, $16.50\"  I then asked if they could, make up a shrimp scampi pizza. \"sorry he replied they just threw it out, and we are unable to make another one.  How could they have possibly made up a pizza within minutes of ordering it.!!!!!   Despite the fact that the young lady quoted a price of 32.50, not only did the manger respond in a rude manner, he hung up on me!  How unprofessional to say the least.  I think, Andy Piche, it's time to fire, and hire, a new manager and his employee.  It's to bad , as we will NEVER order any thing from you again.... Food is good and fresh. VERY consistent with orders, could be better if more options were made in store and not processed and had a chain vibe to it. Owner is great and an institution there. Staff is pleasant but robotic. I like it and go there alot. I always get what I ordered, very efficient and clean. Food was really good and didn't take that long to get Always get their  2 for Tues pizza  buy 1 get 1 free !  Great deal just have to order early  because takes a while as you can imagine  30 - 40 mins usually  great and reasonable family dinner Great place to grab a bite Fresh rolls and just the right amount of meat and other ingredients.I travel 30 miles for their subs.just be aware that Tuesday is buy one get one free pizza day... they are super busy then, wait time is more then also The manager was very rude taking a long time to see if my friends debit card went through and basically he told my friend to f off, never going there anymore. Poor customer service. I recommend you not going there. Great food Great prices Great service! Always good food and friendly people I ordered a salad with Greek dressing & when I poured the dressing out a huge jelly like blob dumped onto my salad. I called them & asked what it was & they said they make dressing fresh on the daily & they were unsure to what it could be. They made me bring the salad BACK to the shop to show them the “ blob “ before they would make me a new salad. At this point I don’t want a new salad I want a refund. Won’t be ordering from here again. Def do not recommend this place. Awful food. Awful customer service. Go to Napolis!!!! Love there food 😍😍😍💕 I ordered Pizza today. It was not what I ordered. When I asked a question the Manager was rude. This is not how to treat your customers. Very Disappointed. Well made sandwiches with great quality ingredients! I had pick up one pizza was good the other one bottom was burnt I called and told them they said they make a new one and they called back said they cant that's how the pizza comes which is not true I've had before the manger promised me a new one and then changed his mind I had get another one else where.cost me double for there burnt pizza I had to wait about 2 minutes for the employee to even acknowledge that I was there because he was playing with papers. I ordered a simple roast beef sandwich. He started to complain about the previous customers order (something about french fries). After about 10 minutes I got my sandwich . It took 10 minutes to throw mayo, cheese, and roast beef on some bread??? They had only one customer before me (the fry guy). I probably won't return (oh and their pizza was burned ) Stopped in for a quick lunch. So I ordered a  slice of pizza and a cup of chicken rice soup.  The pizza was great. I love thin crust pizza. The soup was really good. Hot and loaded with chicken.  Very quick and efficient service. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area. Its pretty decent wait time is slightly above average but you can get a 2 topping lange pizza for like 13 dollars so idk good luck Always good with reasonable prices. I have never had a bad sandwich, pizza or anything on the menu. Everything is good. The only thing is trying to figure out what you want. The roast beef sandwich is one of the best in the area, but very popular place for all kind of other foods. Worth a visit. Always has good food and service Good hot sub Never had a bad meal here. Reasonable prices. Roast beef sandwich had lots beef and was delicious. Terrific pizzas as well. Great food and excellent customer service. I   will definitely be coming back here. Best prices and delicious food. I can't believe how affordable it is! Best tuna, roast beef and other sandwiches. Pizzas are on special every Tuesday. Excellent!!! Still great food after being gone for 7 yrs just stopped in. I just love this restaurant! Great Italian style subs which is my favorite sandwich, so happy to have found this place ❤️ Great food!! Great service!! Great steak cheese pepper onion mushroom sub ; Greek salad was nice and fresh Love this place! AWESOME! Called ..was ready when they said Great food and delivery! Pizza is absolutely fantastic. Great place for a quick bite at reasonable prices. The cold sub. pack good quality meats, although they skimp on the portions. The small Italian had only one slice of mortadela, c'mon, couldn't they spare a bit more? I would give this place five stars but for that reason I will rate it a four. But overall I was satisfied and will return. Great food! Chicken and Rice soup is the best!!  Clam Chowder is really good too! Must try ... Tuna and chicken salad are really good. Steak and cheese is loaded they are not cheap on any of there portions!!! And the roast beef sandwiches are so good!!!  Pizza is excellent ... Would recommend to anyone ...  Marcello is Always busy cause the food is so good 🙂 Good food ,good service I have an issue with the steak subs.  A steak bomb (cheese, onions, peppers AND mushroom) cost less than if you just get steak, cheese, mushroom.  Doesn't make sense.    The food is awesome though. Great roast beef sandwiches.  Full menu of pizzas, grinders, calzones, appetizers, salads. Would seem to be more popular for take out than dining in although plenty of seats. Seems a bit unpredictable about which staff are there to take orders, payments, and where to stand across front counter. We always order the boiled scrod dinner on the weekends. This weekend someone else called in the order for me and I went to pick it up. There was a miscommunication and I picked up a side salad instead of a side of rice when the rice was ordered. We called Marcello’s and explained the mistake and the manager personally apologized and drove over the rice. Great customer service and great food too! they use to have coupons allowing you to buy one hot sub and get another one free for the equivalent price, with a drink. To say one of the few that they had that was great but they got rid of a lot of things like that, including decreasing the amount of toppings you can get the 3 pizza deal Pricey but I absolutely love their steak and cheese subs with extra cheese. Absolute worst buffalo chicken plate I've ever seen. I'm a souz chef, and the first plate I ordered had no sauce at all on the chicken. Of course, I returned it and they remade it..chicken is now soaked in sauce that just isnt buffalo and they gave me 1/2 the portion of fries they did on the first plate which I had to as previously said return. Wouldn't recommend anything on the menu to anyone due to their lack of care they put into their food. Also, buffalo chicken requires buffalo sauce not butter based sauce with no buffalo flavor or any hot flavor for that matter. 100 percent dissatisfied. Delicous pizza! Yum! It is in a very nice area off a main road. If you are in the Whitman area this is a must try! The service is quick and staff are nice. There is more than pizza on the menu and plenty of seating if you choose to dine in. All the food is great! Large Parking lot/plenty of spots. They offer delivery and gift cards! Great food, good prices but service a little slower than I would have hoped. The pizza was excellent! Good selection. Food is slightly above average sub shop fare. Never had pizza so can't rate. Excellent specials. Very good subs and pizza, like using the coupons Came in on a Thursday evening (7:15).\n",
      "Had an onion & mushroom pizza.  I've had better. Seemed as though the dough was not cooked & was not hot when we tasted it. They must not care about business as we sat there for more than 30 minutes listening to the phone constantly ringing. Will not be returning here. Delicious pizza.  Love \"Two fer Tuesdays\".  Terrific for families or for a get together with friends. Awesome food by far. Friendly staff. Would have given 5 stars however I happen to go on a 95 degree day and they had no ac running it was so hot I had to tk my food home! Hint to the owners...A/C Makes a BIG Difference!!! Other than that little hiccup, Love your Pizzas and your subs are phenomenal!! My Fav..Turkey Gobbler!! We go here typically on Tuesday for two for Tuesday pizza. Two bar style small pizzas for the price of one. Very good pizza and subs In my opinion the best Italian subs on the south shore! I know,  I know,  it's a very tall order.  But,  they are a good size,  not huge but a medium will feed a full grown man 99% of the time.  Only when feeling gluttonous will I go large.  The roll is always fresh,  not crumbly dry but just the right amount of hardness in the crust with soft doughy bread in the center.  The veggies are fresh and crisp and there is plenty of cold cuts for the perfect balance.  Writing this review is making me want to order one right now!! We got pizza and subs to try it out. Hamburger, steak n cheese. Cheese pizza and pepperoni. Omg no thank you worst i ever had. Actually ended up throwing it out and making microwave pizza...1000% better. I could not believe how bad it was. Use your own judgement...but wouldnt go back Good sandwiches and service is good. Great roast beef sandwich melted in my mouth could of eaten like 4 of them very causal place big dinning room seems like the place is more of a take out place though My husband says BEST Italian sub ever, great quality food 👍 It was great the only thing is the cook didn't follow the instructions thats all! Austin at the counter excellent service... Shrimp scampi pizza delicious The cheeseburger pizza is def of a craving quencher. Even the plain cheese pizza is amazing. The only thing to think about is a large cheese is $8 or $8.30 and a small is $7.40. Just a thought Food is very good, not the best pizza I have had in the area but it's pretty good. Prices are great. Beer select leave a lot to be desired. Service is always fast and friendly. The gluten free pizza is awful! It is tiny,made of cauliflower crust and comes out crunchy and overcooked.Spencer's Abington for the best gluten free pizza! The food was delicious and Andy was the best!!  New fans from Cranston, RI I was pleasantly surprised by roast beef sandwich that melted in my mouth. Always love coming here and getting the chicken brocolli pasta..its hot, delicious and comes with amazing garlic bread I always have trouble calling. No one ever answers the phone Its ok Food was good. Restroom was clean. Had some things you don't usually see on the menu. Tasty food,friendly staff and great price. Andy..whats happened? Your pizza was always one of the best in the area...not so any more. Last 3 visits pizza was bland. New sauce??  New cheese??  Even the greek salads...very little Feta.  Get rid of the coupons and go back to the quality pizza and salad. The roast beef on a bulky roll and any condiments you wish is d'lish! Best roast beef sandwich! Sandwich was great BUT very slow from order to pick up Love coming here for the hot pastrami and cole slaw. Everything is very fresh and large quantities. Great atmosphere and roomy as well. There is also an amazing variety of food as well. Don't miss this in your travels Clean , friendly workers ,foods good too lol wife  and i walked in to this place round 530 5-4-19 and it was super busy took it to go but service was like they didnt care much about customers no thank you no smile and very slow just took my debit card and scan it they did not look at it on the back of it says CID   food was fair at best and  was made very very very sloppy i had a turkey wrap and it fell apart soon as i picked it up fell all all over the plate i had luckily i had one  and the oil that they put on it pored out of warp and all over my pants  and i did not ask for any oil wife had a steak and  cheese said it was ok but cheese was hard and steak was a bit under cooked  i may or may not Return i,ve heard  good things about this place i hope some one reads this and responds too this im disappointed about this....im sorry but i tell it like it is ...... Great food!! Really hit or miss here. Used to be great everytime but now it's hard to even place an order. If you get lucky the subs can be really good; but it seems more likely now days that the kid making it doesn't care at all. Great food, but the organization is awful. I cannot see myself going there again. Sadly, it was a favorite childhood restaurant that has really gone downhill in service. Went in to pick up a phone order, and waited an additional 20  minutes on the quoted time Great South Shore \"bar style\" pizza at fair prices. The pizza here is very good. This was such a terrible experience\n",

      "ZERO stars B1 g1 gree pizza tuesdays baby! Service was unbelievably slow. We called in an order. We were told it would be 15 min... took 30. It was 830 on a Monday night...no other customers. Awesome seafood salad Best Italian sub in the area. This place is great. First time here, but we would definitely go again. The sandwiches were filling, and thenfries were hot and crispy. Just took a chance. Glad we did, and Yes we would stop there again. Food has gone way downhill and the staff are incompetent...waited 1.25hrs for delivery only to call and them to tell me it hadn't been made yet and they had one driver.  Maybe tell me before?  I've given them a lot of chances since their food used to be great but never again.  They've lost my business.  And Bill Sears is the rudest manager I've ever talked to, worst customer service skills ever...what an idiot. Lobster roll looked better than it was. Food was good, as was the value, but slow. Phones also busy, but slow to be answered Trash food trash staff should be closed immediately This place is pricey for lowsey food I won't be back better pizza shops else where Great food great service Food is very good. Best Cobb salad in Massachusetts pretty good food here with decent prices. The fried chicken sandwich basket has been a common choice among my friends. They have a combo for 6.99 which includes a small drink,  4inch sub, and a small side or soup. If u order an Italian sub, make sure u ask for lettuce tomatoes and pickles/hots before u leave! Place has went downhill drastically. They will never give you a time estimate on when you’ll get your food because they are so slow. Foods always cold Excellent food, great deals with their coupons.  Today I had their chicken rice soup and a tuna sub.  Soup was delicious,  and their tuna is the best.   Meatballs are also the best around. Cheese steak sub, big sandwich for a small. Tastes good too! Best pizza in town, grabbed my bottle from temple liquors, smoke my Boston Hempire flower, and ate some of the best pizza I've ever had. Thanks Marcello Small cheese pizza is the best, just get that trust me The only reason this place deserves one star is because the food is edible (If you don't mind grease dripping down your arm). The prices are absurd compared to the quality and there is never less than a 45 minute wait, even for the simplest of orders. The staff was rude, answering multiple calls while I stood waiting to speak with someone, and the manager was completely unconcerned with the fact that i was upset with the situation. She insisted that there was nothing wrong with the fact that despite calling a half hour ahead, my husband sat waiting for 45 minutes while I was with our crying kids in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never. Ever. Again!!!!!!!!!! I will never go Marcello's in Whitman again. I used to be one of their most loyal customers but I honestly can't be anymore, not with how I was treated. They are so rude, all they do is scream at you and hang up on you for a mistake that they have made.  I spoke with the owner who told me it wasn't his problem and hung up on me for a mistake that THEY made. I love their food but is the horrible customer service really worth it? I don't think so. I don't think they realize if they are not nice to their customers they will not have any. Pepperoni is good Love their fish specially. Went in close to closing and still received good service and good food to go. Their baskets are really affordable if you're looking for a quick eat. Best steak and cheese subs around. In the summer, best lobster rolls around served on a butter grilled foot long hot dog bun. Their french fries can't be beat. Stopped into Marcello's on a whim and was very pleased with our meals. Food is always good, staff is friendly and place was clean. Been in business since I was a kid so they are doing something right still! The food is mediocre and they have the slowest service Hands down the absolutley worst steak and cheese I ever tasted. Not enough cheese and steak is watery. Best pizza and subs on the south shore.. If you are looking for a good sandwich, pizza, or dinner baskets, this is the place.priced reasonably, plenty of parking, large dining area, or to go. Food is good but the wait is ridiculous. The menu says that it’s no wait or a short wait yet for 2 cold subs I waited Near a hour. Food has gone so far down hill, its as if they have recently changed owners, or made some other poor business choices.  If you check their facebook reviews, you will notice one of their employees who isn't the brightest, as well as someone you wouldn't want touching your food.  I guess im ordering papa ginos until something better comes along. Good food. Worst service in town without a doubt. The owner or someone needs to do something about it Great food. Tuesday pizza deals...tuna sub rocks. Subs are HUGE Awesome food! Great location at the corner of routes 18 and 27. A-Town favorite, quite the variety on the menu. Stop in and try it you'll love it. Food was fantastic! Subs are huge! I had ordered food from your location and was very unhappy with my order! I waited an hour for a sandwich that doesn’t even get cooked and an order of fries. If it is busy they should say it will be longer than expected! The fries also were not even warm. I work in a resteraunt so I know how it is. If the wait is a while they are to let the customer know. Amazing food and amazing customer service! Food is good. But expect to wait at least an hour for delivery. I live 3 mins away and wait an hour every time. Currently waiting now,...an hour and 15 mins so far and no food :( good steak and ch. pizza is good too but usually put alot of tomatoe sauce but aside from that its okay . Great Two for pizza deal on Tuesdays. Would recommend picking up that day instead of dilivery for convenientce. Had a cpl pieces of pizza it was very good Good food but always a long wait for food after placing the order Friendly staff, good food and great prices...def worth a visit big menu, good pizza\n",
      "ihad a steak & cheese, no seasoning so it was a bit bland, good ammount of steak Unfortunately the slowest dine in experience I have ever had. Waited over 30 minutes for 3 subs. 6 people working behind the counter. Horrible experience Very good food. Workers are a little unfriendly. DO NOT ORDER A LOBSTER ROLL FROM HERE. HAVEN'T COME ACROSS 1 CHUNK OF LOBSTER. NO FLAVOR EXCEPT MAYO. $23.+ for mayo and a roll oh yeah a small bag of chips. So so mad and dissapointed. Place is horrible, Service is even worse, We ordered as a company and we were told 25 minutes until delivery, (Mind you the Restaurant and the business they are delivering too are only 5 minutes apart) ...So almost a whole hour passes and still no sign of the food. We call and they say it just left for delivery , no apology . We all get our food..$80 Later and everything that is supposed to be hot is cold. We call back to let them know we are highly disappointed and were told that they are too busy to accommodate delivery times and apologized . NO offer of a refund or discount or even an offer of a fresh reorder. Bad customer service. The pizza is usually okay when its actually Hot . As you can tell by reading this review, the company and myself will no longer be ordering from Marcellos.  The lady who answered the phone was rude. So i decided to leave a Google review. Since she doesn't care maybe everyone on Google might. I recently moved down to the South Shore about 8 years ago. So I decided to order  Marcellos pizza one night . I wouldn't go there again and I Haven't gone since. Highly not recomended in my opinion Great customer service and best tuna in Whitman that I’ve had anyways. My only regret is that the 2 ‘fer Tuesday deal is only on small pizzas, and not specialty pizzas. Have gotten my delivery order wrong on numerous occasions.  Can't even eat the steak and cheese calzone (which was supposed to be a steak and cheese pizza) because it's so doughy and sloppy that it just falls apart.  Waste of 15 dollars. Always a long wait!  Poor customer service.   I was asked to wait a minute after being ignored for literally 10 min when I got someone's attention, again,  my order had been sitting waiting on the shelf the whole time. Ugh! Rude, awful food and false advertising! I will never go back Way too much mayonnaise in the lobster roll and two shreds of lettuce.  Disappointed. Great veggie melts eat their steak and cheese subs as well as the pockets yummy ! Ok sub shop. Good hot dog basket for kids. My son loves them. Awesome tuna. Service was great Nice place. Quiet, and good food Gross.  Especially the pizza sauce, also the workers there have attitude problems Good food! Needs to improve speed of service There is no better place to get a calzone!

      "Mistakes are never good, but the way they are handled speaks well for the character of a business, and in this regard Marcellos passed with flying colors! Awful from food to staff Great pastrami sandwich Food is amazing especially the steak tips. Great place to eat Great customer service and  the food is awesome Great food fast service The Food Is Great! The Portions Not So Much... Awesome subs, friendly staff and unbeatable deals.  I would recommend them time and time again!!! Great food great prices They were shutdown for day, for the non blizzard, very upset, poor judgement Best pizza! And u can't beat buy 1get 1free Tuesday. Food is good Expensive subs always bring a buy 1 get 1 coupon Lots of menu choices, food was good. Excellent food decent portions Best 🍕 Good. Went downhill.. Not my favorite. Great food Good subs Love it Poor service and I will be speaking with the owner about why I called for my food and it was not started. Won't be back..... Not a fan food is great  but never going there again on a Tuesday night waited almost an hour for a sub and a cheeseburger plate and they originally said 20 minutes Pizza is excellent.. Food is good service is terrible. Poorly managed employees and no professionalism in front of customers Great! Not terrible Slooooow Always late, greasy, customer service is terrible.  Owner, Andy terrible and VERY disrespectful.  Whatever happened to \"the customer is always right\"   They suck and will never ever return Very busy place. Be prepared to wait if you go there for dinner on a Friday night. Not what it used to be.. Good food Excellent  food Best meatball sub around! Good portions of food Always on point New cook Great food!! Something about the pizza doesn't taste right They have the best pizza Love the pizza Good pizza Always good subs Pretty good food Great food! Because the food is 👌 Pizza You buttmad, Cam?\n",
      "The menu at this place is huge to match the portion sizes. We had a Steak Bomb sub and the name fits - it was the bomb. Small meat lovers calzone and our 22 yo couldn't finish it. The same with my wives Roast Beef Sub took half home. The superbeef I just received didn't even look like roastbeef. It had no texture and literally a pile of mush and arrived ice cold (ended up in the trash) Husband and I shared the Fisherman's Platter tonight and it was amazing! Thought it was odd that it came in a medium size pizza box,  but believe that the box helped to keep it hot and crispy. Large portions that included 4 lobster claws! Reasonably priced, cooked perfectly and even have leftovers for tomorrow. Will definitly try it again. Best roast beef around! I ordered from Londi’s a lot! I liked their food. But even after having them repeat the order back to me they screwed up the order. Every. Single. Time! Multiple times, I’ve never received a delivery that didn’t have a mistake!! I will never order from Londi’s again! I’m over it! Salem House of Pizza all the way, it is their equal to better and they actually get the order right. they aren’t missing with the chicken caesar salad. when you pick it up, and it’s heavy, that’s the first good sign, as it means they’re not going skimpy on the ingredients... when you take a bite and it’s good, that’s the most important sign. the romaine  is green and crisp, lots of thinly sliced cheese, generous portion of homemade croutons(some places only give a few croutons which clearly aren’t homemade, but these ones definitely are), the chicken is perfectly cooked with a pleasant seasoning, and they give a lot of chicken. the caesar dressing was delicious and the cup was the right\n",
      "amount for the salad. inside the atmosphere is good. the place is clean, pricing is fair, and everyone is friendly. i know chicken caesar is simple to make,\n",
      "but many places do it poorly. londis does it well! We ordered a Buffalo zone finger sub and they sent us a la finger sub with sauce on the side, when we called the processed to tell use that we where wrong and that they will not do anything for us. This such disappointment that we try to just order a simple meal 🥘 and the customer service horrible. And that when you spend your hard earned money in this tough times. And you try to support the local business they just don’t support you the consumer.\n",
      "Sincerely\n",
      "Jon Luna\n",

      "Sent from my iPhone I stopped going to Londis for a while as their quality of food changed and not in a good way... Until I tried their food again and to my surprise it was great and the customer service was also great... Glad I decided to go back!! Food is good, but the staff barely speaks enough English to place a telephone order. So frustrating. Best chicken kabob salads. Everything is good there I came back to change my review! I ordered last night around 9:50pm. I didn't know they were closing at 10pm and they still took my order. I ordered a roast beef sub, crabmeat salad and a pizza everything was delicious. Never had a bad item from this place! Been going here when I'm in the area! Great 🍕 Good food clean place keep up the good work\n",
      "Next time I'm there I expect a free something Good food. Good customer service. The food was so delicious and the staff so friendly Burger very sloppy , didn’t get what I asked for. Very angry with the quality of fries and burger Steak tips and chicken parm are pretty underwhelming. Better food options around for similar or less money Very quick service and good food Got a super beef sauce and cheese. It was cold and overall meh. Probably won't be back Best food ever Huge menu and everything is good. House salad dressing also very good. Super beef hot pastrami and lastly the pizza 😉 I took a ride with my neighbor who got a cheese pizza there.  She loves their food!!! Everything here is fantastic. Great service, too. The last couple weeks ive spent probably hundreds of dollars eating at this place getting take out. Wanted the $6.99 cheese pizza so i ordered 2 plus a bunch of other food totaling over 60 dollars again and refused to honor the 6.99 for the cheese pizzas. Called to cancel and got hung up on. Real nice place Basic fast food joint. PERIOD A little pricey for what you get, but the food quality is solid So my husband loves this place and don’t get me wrong their food is good. But let me tell you about the part that sucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think the customer is always right but when the customer is wrong and admits the mistake I would hope a business would understand and remake a simple sandwich instead of standing there arguing with the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "SECOND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I asked for a side of cheese sauce on a completely separate visit and they microwaved it as usual and to check the consistency, a fellow employee stuck his finger in it without a glove and decided it wasn’t done and proceeded to microwave it. That was the last straw.... I work close by and come here all the time for a sub or sandwich. They are polite, fast and provide great food👍 I work close by and come here all the time for a sub or sandwich. They are polite, fast and provide great food👍 Great local place! Pizza, subs, soups, salads - everything is excellent! Highly recommended! Peabody is much better and worth the drive. This place is mismanaged and mediocre. I’m not one to review or complain, but the inefficiency and lack of communication in this restaurant is unreal. Prepare to be stared at by people standing doing nothing while you wait for food that is ready. I’m done with this place. Been disappointed too many times and that’s on me I guess but if I can save anyone frustration in the future then this post was worth it. PLEASE AVOID. Great pizza. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza, and it was so good Great food got to call ahead though if you order in store it takes a while When you order a pizza you expect that it will  at least be fresh & hot. Dripping cheese, with fresh ingredients. I ordered a large pizza in house & waited for it to be done, which I received in 10 minutes. After  my  2 mile drive home, the pizza was barely warm. I don't understand how a freshly made pizza would lose its heat in a 5 minute ride. The texture was very chewy, the cheese was extremely salty. The dough was stale tasting. Looking under the crust appeared that it had baking marks of color, then why was the pizza so cold? The condition of the pizza makes me wonder if the pizza was premade stored in a  refrigerator, taken out and (note I said warmed & not cooked,) when needed. I will not be returning to Londi's of Salem again.  It's sad that I have to give them such a bad review. They used to have some of the best pizza in town but now it's absolutely awful. Got super sick Love their food. Great prices. The food is pretty good. The prices aren't bad. Chicken fingers and steak fries are my go to. They make good buffalo fingers. They are above average for a roast beef shop. Food is usually decent however they are slower than slow.  I call ahead and place an order, they tell me ten minutes, I arrive in twenty minutes and I still have to wait.  Both times I've ordered a Roast Beef sandwich.  The beef is already cooked and all you have to do is put it on bread and wrap it up.  Shouldn't take a half our. Seriously. Best roast beef in the area The pizzas are terrific hand have great flavor. They also have anchovies! Ordered here lastnight. Got a chicken dinner plate. It supposed to come with two sides the order taker said. Ok I ask for half plain fries half spicy fries. I also ordered a sub\n",
      "It was almost 30 bucks for it. I assumed it was just pricey. I get home no complaints about the sub I was told it was good. But the chicken plate had 4 pieces of chicken a ton a plain fries and a handful of spicy ones. I notice while trying my food the receipt they charged me an additional 4 bucks for that handful of spicy fries that was supposed to be my other side. That was my first and last time I will ever go there. Also the chicken was gross Excellent food. Large amount for the price Our online order was incorrect. We were given steak instead of chicken. We order online to avoid a situation where an order is misheard on the phone. If an online order doesn’t go directly to the business and still needs to be typed in by a person behind a register, what’s the point? The prices were jacked up so to expensive for me. They cut down the roast beef sandwiches and the beef was cold... Best steak bomb I've had a long time. Amazing amounts of food, only had to wait about 8 minutes for fries, and it was about 20 minutes for a calzone. I do think that the food could have had more flavor, but it was still good and used very fresh ingredients :) Not very appetizing :(\n",
      "The pizza is bland, super-greasy and uses what tasted like old, clumpy melted cheese on top.\n",
      "The rice bowls used to be ok, but they switched to some bright yellow rice which isn't a good change at all.\n",
      "The salads are just ur standard, run-of-the-mill directly prepped a few days ago and stored till an order comes in.\n",
      "Our family if 4 used to go to Londi's often and the food was ok for an ok price. I'm not sure if they changed ownership or what, but we don't order from there anymore since the quality of food and the recipes went so far down hill. We just got a takeout order! Great service and convenience. Food is great price is right Horrible burnt fries and chicken wings to expensive also my husband steak very very salty .i had this place not worth the money . I am a regular customer and I agree with everyone here who claims it has gone way downhill since new management took over. The quality of the food is excellent, the place is always spotless, and the place has the potential to be great. Since new management has been in place since last year, the service has been way below par and I have had to send orders back at least 6 out of 20 times. Be extremely specific over the phone and confirm orders completely with them just in case. When they are focused- it is a very good experience. Hasn't really been the same since the New Owner showed up, the food quality I mean. Just a few days ago I ordered a Chicken Caesar Wrap and found long strands of HAIR in it! I couldn't finish it. Great food, reasonable prices for the food that you get, and super-clean bathrooms! Very good fast service excellent food Awesome food choices, nice sized portions...bery reasonably priced and quality of food. Definitely a repeat dine in... This place has some of the best pizza I've had in a long time.  The steak tips were seasoned so well.   I was pleasantly surprised by the food here.  The prices are very reasonable.\n",
      "They also helped me get to my car with my food since I had my kids with me. They were so nice.  I'll definitely go back. Food is good but customer service is awful. Not very welcoming. Owner who took my order looked mad and did not thank me or smile. He didnt say 2 words to me. Very unprofessional. Not very happy with this place. Poor selection for people with allergies.  Staff were a mix of friendly and rude. Good roast beef. Professional setting. Cops seem to like this place. Pepsi products. I have only had the roast beef. I'm a North Shore native and take roast beef sandwiches seriously. So do Londis. The sandwich was perfectly warm, sauced well and most importantly the meat was sliced perfectly thin. It melts in your mouth. I'm looking forward to going again. I Also must say I witnessed the staff being incredible kind to their customers. One gentleman in particular who seem that perhaps had been down on his luck or has experienced some misfortune was there. The staff perhaps knew him. They went out of their way to be kind to him and treat him with great respect. It was nice to see. Kudos. Londi's has very good Chicken parmesan dinners and their pizza is good as well. Go to londi's for good food Food was OK. Ordered salad myself, it was fresh. My colleague ordered a pizza and he liked it. The place is quite small though. i love it Place has gone down hill in the past few years.  Be careful ordering online, I have had them charge me, and never got the food.  When I complain they blame it on someone else, and I never get credited.  Working on disputing the charge with my credit card. Thieves. I used to order fresh wings all the time and now when I do they give you breaded wing dings. Not cool. This has happened twice already so I’m no longer ordering from them. I got the meat lovers panzerotti (sp?) With jalepenos. It was amazing!!  Had enough for leftovers, 2 days later and cold it was still very yummy.  We fought over who was going to get the last piece. ;) It was my first visit, and I was pleasantly surprised. The I asked for a small steak sub and a small fry, since I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I couldn't believe how stuffed the sub was, and I got a whole plate of fries. Needless to say, I had delicious leftovers. I also noticed the cleanliness and customer service. Definitely going back soon!! Tha good 👍 Tasty food but a bit pricey. Good food. Nice clean place. Home made chicken cutlets...😕\n",
      "Inedible....pricey Great calzones, subs, and the chicken Alfredo is Awesome! Never a problem with pick up, delivery, or dine-in. And if you order from the slice app they have great deals! Delicous pizza and really goid pasta alfredo! No fancy dining here just great food. Best locally around. Great food at reasonable prices Good but pricey The best roastbeef sandwiches. Everything is good I think the new owners have really done a great job making Londis better! There's more variety for chicken wings, sandwiches and ingredients seem fresher and not as skimpy as before. Very Poor delivery service... Took an hour and 18 minutes for 2 small subs and a side of Mac n cheese bites and i live .2 miles away..not even half a mile.. After that shenanigan-fest...my Order was wrong! and & the Food was cold on arrival. It needed to be reheated..once reheated it was good otherwise. But Will not do delivery with these guys again. Used to be my go to for grilled chicken salads but I'll have to find a new place since this new owner has taken over. I've had it twice since the switch and the food isn't terrible, it's just not as good as it was. I don't know what they are doing differently but it's definitely different. We go to Londi's all the time. The food is quality and consistent. It's hard to ask for anything more. Great food, very clean, pleasant and fast service Over cooked and dry.  Not what you go to the north shore to eat. The food was awesome  recommended to everyone Very very good chicken and food in general. Nice ambience and good service. I recommend it. I just dont understand how at noon (hardly what one would consider to be a popular ordering time nor a time where traffic would be congested) it takes well over an hour to deliver a cold sub and fries hardly half a mile up the road. Haven't had much here yet but was recommended by coworkers and everything I've had so far was delicious. Always go when I'm nearby Don't like their tartar sauce Food was great Everyone was very nice Good food good service 👍 Atrocious customer service, even worse food.  Got my order completely wrong and tried to convince me that it was what I ordered. Wouldn’t give me a full refund.  Never going back to this worthless establishment Good food .clean.friendly management my favorites are calzone and fettucine Alfredo wth chicken broccoli.pizza is good also By far the worst roast beef sandwich I've ever had! Paid over eight dollars for a super beef three-way took over 20 minutes to get it only to take about three bites to throw it away Absolutely cold all the way through cheese wasn't melted and roast beef was big fatty pieces and Bearly  chewable. Waste of my time and money never again Good steak and cheese here. I called to tell them that the order was wrong and I asked for a manager and the manager yelled at me was very rude and told me he wasn’t going to do anything about it and hung up on me Ordered 2 roast beef 3ways and a large chicken finger meal. Got home and the roast beefs had no bbq sauce and the chicken finger meal was a kids size. Went back to get a refund and the manager refused to refund the chicken finger meal but did refund the roast beefs. Would have kept quiet if he refunded the entire screwed up meal. But now I’ll never go back. Favorite beef spot around. Their greek salad is also great - really large - almost 3 meals if you ask for extra pita. The house dressing is to die for. I like ordering here because it’s pretty simple for lunch. But the fact that the delivery drivers don’t speak good english whatsoever has caused way too many problems. The fact that he had to call me and ask that if I spoke Spanish was unprofessional. Not knowing how to find the correct building when I’ve clearly given them directions is ridiculous and time consuming. Then I get a call from the shop pointing fingers at me and saying that it was my fault. So whoever the lady is that takes the orders was rude and clearly doesn’t know the meaning of customer service. Plus my food was cold/soggy by the time they actually got the food to me. I regret leaving a tip. Very nice food, very good service, great location, very nice environment. All the family loved it and we shall definitely come back. The service was excellent along with the 3 subs I purchased. High priced but worth it for top quality ingredients. Changing my review of Londis for the simple fact that a couple of months back my husband and I placed an order online for delivery that never showed up. We called and got no answer even though it was before closing time for them. Our card was charged and we reached out via email about the situation requesting a refund several times and never got a response or the refund. This is terrible customer service and we will no longer order from them. Large portions, great prices, excellent food and smiling faces. And they deliver! Try the chicken kabob salad. Service is okay they could be a little more friendly . The food is delicious roast beef 3 way is the best Good food at this place.. The steak and the non breaded chicken wings are a must have if you want to try this place out. Good pizza in Londis of peabody.  However, instead of serving it on a pizza tray stand, the waitress placed it on a hot tray on the table, right near my young daughter (with no warning about this).  Luckily she didn't get burnt, though I'd hate to see this happen to someone else. Little pricey but a great place for great food . Nothing but the best. Everything they make is so good. Large portions,  and delicious. An outstanding experience in every way. Tasting menu was excellent and service was perfect. Excellent food and excellent service! Not in a very good location, but who cares. Great Caesar salad wrap unfortunately nothing else was very good. I tried the pizza , chicken parm sub and steak and cheese. One of the best roast beef sandwiches I've ever had. Huge and delicious Chicken Caesar Salad. Nice place, I recommend!!! Nice place to eat. As this place is new they serve  huge portions, which is great !    Thank you guys and please keep a good job Great food, fair price, good delivery. Never had a bad sub from this place! Their tuna is awesome! Amazing food,  i always say  pasta Li vista baby!!!! ,  GOOD FOOD GOOD MOOD Chicken parm calzone was aweful,  not done good... Usually most items front them but won't get that again... i think there are new owners too... upon reading I was right... use to be Greek owners now Indian guys and food has been less than impressive Best roast beef around great prices everything else on the menu is great from buff wings to garlic bread with cheese ,salads ,pizza staff if friendly and welcoming. I work across the street I go there for lunch 2 3 times a week Roast beef was great. Generous with the fries. Good beefs First they gave me someone else’s order. Then they messed up mine.  Didn’t notice until I got home. The management team here is awesome and they respond quickly! Great place 🥰 Good food good atmosphere will definitely visit again. Awesome place.. huge roast beef sammys. Has gone down hill. I was wondering why until one day I picked up a couple of girls from there for an Uber ride. They explained how it's changed owners. Love them ,the prices r pretty  darn good  ,who cares if it's limited English, they r really nice ,very fast delivery, and always accurate try the hambuger club...you'll love it!!! Everything is BOMB.. portions are Bigger then anywhere I've ever been for a Beef joint. Love that place.😎 This place is Awesome ! The food is great and good customer service Ordered a calzone and delivery guy showed up with French fries and ZERO calzone , still waiting for the calzone ..... it’s been 3 years Delicious food  good friendly service,  if it's busy it's a good sign.  A must try. Quality, price , service and cleanliness Good food decent atmosphere buddy holly lives Great food I called to make an order and the lady was soo unprofessional, she asked for my address and then took my order. She then said she erased my order and retook my order, as I was asking questions about the menu a man came on the phone and said they don't deliver to my residence. He stated they only deliver in a 3 mile radius and that my address was 3.1 miles away. I then asked him why my order was taken and then I was told this, he said he didn't know. After the phone call ended, I googled my address to this place and it is exactly within 3 miles of eachother! Very unprofessional and rude. And a shame because this was my first time trying to order from this place and I will never try their food due to the rudeness and poor customer service! Awesome and friendly environment, but most importantly, the food is tasty.  Definitely the place to order from and eat. Service quick.  Good good. We get veal parm marinara sub. Their  calzones are excellent also. Great service.. Whoever is taking the orders here need to learn what customer service is. She was very rude and she acted like i was bothering her ! Theres so many pizza shops that every customer should be valued. My order was wrong i ordered a buffalo finger dinner with salad an fries and i got rice ! I dont even eat rice. When i called back to tell her my order was wrong she sat there an told me what i ordered when i know i didnt order rice. Unsteady of trying to keep me as a customer she continued to tell me i was wrong ! Sorry but this place needs to hire someone with some experience with vustomers! I will happily work for yall and better your business! Got chicken kabob Greek wrap was huge and insane amount of chicken Great food a little expensive but all and all good, Good food, descent prices, fast delivery Customer Service Speak Limited English. They Just Changed  Ownership ,\n",
